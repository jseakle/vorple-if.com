## Vorple in depth

Back in the days when home computers first entered consumer markets there
were many competing companies selling computers that weren't compatible with
each other. To maximize the amount of potential customers
[Infocom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom) had to solve the problem of
programming and distributing their games to a wide array of computers with
varying specifications and limitations.

The solution was to create a virtual machine that would harmonize the
differences between computer systems. The game file would always be the same
for each system and there would be a system-specific interpreter program that
would translate the game file into instructions the computer understood.
This way the game could be programmed and compiled only once and it would work
on any system that had an interpreter written for it.

The virtual machine was called _Z-machine_ after Zork, the first game
that used it. Decades later Inform 7 still compiles to Z-machine (and Glulx,
the contemporary virtual machine that works basically the same way but with
many of Z-machine's limitations removed).

To a modern consumer of interactive fiction the virtual machine model has
other benefits in addition to being able to play the stories in a wide
selection of devices. The virtual machine is effectively a _sandbox_
that limits what story files are allowed to do. They can't, for example,
delete files from the computer, install malicious software or access your
webcam. When you download an interactive fiction story file you can be certain
that it isn't a virus and it can't do anything harmful.

To an author of interactive fiction the sandbox can sometimes feel rather
limiting. We've come a long way since the early days of Infocom and the
things we now casually do with computers is far more than anyone could have
dreamed of 30 years ago. Yet interactive fiction is still confined to
streaming text, displaying pictures, playing sounds and performing some
limited file operations.

Cue the Internet age. A modern web browser is also a sandbox, but with quite
a lot of more capabilities (but still with restrictions in place so that in
theory you can visit any web page and be sure that you can't catch anything
malicious).

Parchment, the first wide-spread web interpreter, was a small revolution in
itself and turned the community focus from downloadable story files to
Internet play, but Parchment and other Z-machine and Glulx interpreters are
still "only" implementations of existing virtual machines.
They restrict the story files to the same sandbox as offline interpreters do.

This is where Vorple comes in. It makes a small addition to the interpreter
so that the story files can break free of the sandbox and
communicate with the browser that's running the interpreter.

With this bridge in place the story file can do pretty much whatever it
wants with the user interface and the story text â€” even story text that
has already been printed.

Vorple's Inform extensions use this feature to interact with the interpreter,
the browser and the JavaScript libraries bundled with the Vorple interpreter
package. For example, the Vorple Tooltips extension issues commands to the
[PowerTip](https://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/) library that
displays the actual tooltips.

To accomplish this, Vorple uses a virtual filesystem. When targeting Glulx,
Inform story files have a limited file read and write capability. The story
file writes the JavaScript code to a specifically named file, and the
Vorple interpreter captures these file writes and instead executes the
JavaScript code.

The story file uses a similar system to decide whether it's running in a Vorple
interpreter. The interpreter provides a special (virtual) file for the Inform
story to read. If the file exists and has the correct content, Vorple features
can be enabled.


## Support

The project's headquarters are at [vorple-if.com](http://vorple-if.com) where
you'll find all the official materials and downloads. JavaScript developers who
want to dig into the innards of the system can find the source code at
[GitHub](http://github.com/vorple).

The best place to look for assistance is the community forum at
[intfiction.org](http://intfiction.org/forum). Vorple's author
frequents the forum, as do other experienced authors who are happy to
answer civilized help requests about authoring with Inform, Vorple or other
systems.

Bugs can be reported at the project's GitHub pages. Issues related
to the interpreter should go to
[the main repository](https://github.com/vorple/vorple/issues)
and issues related to the Inform extensions to either
[the I6 library repository](https://github.com/vorple/inform6/issues) or
[the I7 extensions repository](https://github.com/vorple/inform7/issues).
If you're not sure which to use, post to an extensions repository.

Vorple and all official materials are open source and free for anyone
to use for any purpose. (Mandatory footnote: Do still read all the licenses
if you want to use it commercially or as a part of a closed system.
Some third party libraries, for example, are subject to slightly more
restrictive licenses.)
