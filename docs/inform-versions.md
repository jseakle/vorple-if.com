title: Choosing between Inform 6 and Inform 7
---

In this documentation we'll cover everything you need to make your own Vorple 
games, apart from Inform programming itself.

Vorple supports both Inform 6 and Inform 7. Despite having the same name, 
they're quite different systems, Inform 6 being a more traditional programming
language and Inform 7 a more modern version with English-like syntax. Both
systems are equally suitable for use with Vorple, and the choice between them
is up to individual preference.  

* Inform 6 is available at [inform-fiction.org](http://inform-fiction.org).
*[Inform Beginner's Guide](https://inform-fiction.org/manual/about_ibg.html)* 
is a set of beginner level tutorials and the often praised fourth edition of 
*[Designer's Manual](https://inform-fiction.org/manual/about_dm4.html)* aka *DM4*
goes through the system more thoroughly. Inform 6 has currently better support
for making games in languages other than English.

* Inform 7 can be downloaded from [inform7.com](http://inform7.com).
A good place to start is the built-in manual,
[other documentation](https://intfiction.org/t/the-list-of-inform-7-documentation-as-of-19-dec-2011/3311)
is also available. Inform 7 is the most popular system for parser-based games 
and easier to get into without programming experience.

From now on we'll assume that you know at least the basics of either of those 
languages and know how to create a simple playable game.
